A Guide to Hacking in the Compiler Source
=========================================

You can generate the type hierarchy using the script `src/hierarchy.sh`

Questions to Benoît
===================

- Why `&` and `|` are duplicated in `EXPR_AND_LOGIC`, `EXPR_AND`,
  `EXPR_OR_LOGIC` and `EXPR_OR`. Is that for optimization purposes knowing that
  the logic AND might not have to keep the exact result of the arithmetic AND?

- Why no postcondition in `LIST.execute` ?

        [ // make sure LIST.execute return a list
          +? { + l:LIST; l ?= Result != NULL };
        ]

Global Variables
================

Found in `ANY`. Look at the type definitions for details about the types.

- `list_main:LIST` is the list of the `main()` function.

- `profil_current:PROFIL`: the profil being executed in the current execution
  pass.

- `seq_list:FAST_ARRAY(LIST)`: the list hierarchy during the execute pass.
  First comes the containing lists and then the contained lists. This is sort of
  a stack trace.

- `list_current:LIST`: the current list being executed. This is not always the
  last element of `seq_list` as when a `PROFIL` is executed, the `list_current`
  is reset to `NULL`.

- `modify_count:INTEGER`: How many times a new pass was requested during the
  current pass.


Passes
======

Passes can be found in `PROTOTYPE.depend`. The passes continues until
`modify_count` hasn't increased in the pass.

Depending Pass
--------------

This is where all the parsing happens and all the abstract syntax tree (AST) is
generated.

Main code in `NODE.extend_pass`. This will walk through all the `NODE_TYPE`s
and `update` them. A `NODE_TYPE` is a possible polymorphic call that need
resolution. If the `update` return `TRUE`, it means that the node no longer need
to be updated and can be skipped from the depending pass next time.

Executing Pass
--------------

Recursive executing pass is in `PROFIL_LIST.execute_pass_recursive`

Main code in `PROFIL_LIST.execute` with some code before and after in
`PROTOTYPE.depend` to cleanup before a new pass or check something that would
trigger a new pass.

`PROFIL_LIST` contain all profils for slots generated. They are ordered with the
profils that are alive first, and the dead profils last. There are three
categories of profils:
- the profils that are always alive (`Section External`) below `life_limit_base`
- the profils alive for the current executing pass below `life_limit`
- the dead profils with an index greater or equal to `life_limit`.

A standard execution pass is like this:

1. First, all profils alive from the previous pass are marked dead (lower
   `life_limit` to `life_limit_base`)
2. It call `execute` on `list_main`
3. For the profils (`profil_current`) that were marked alive during the previous
   step, it call `execute` on them.
4. Clean the dead profils.
5. Determine if there is a need for a new executing pass.

A recursive execution pass has `PROFIL.mode_recursive` to `TRUE` and is similar
to a normal execution pass, with some differences.

Code Generation
---------------

Generate function signatures: `PROFIL_LIST.genere_handler`

Generate the `main()` source code: `LIST.genere_extern`

Generate functions: `PROFIL_LIST.genere`

Abstract Syntax Tree
====================

The objects descending from `ITM_CODE` and `ITM_ARGUMENT` and `ITM_TYPE` and
more generally, all items in the `item` directory form the abstract syntax tree.

# `ITM_ARGUMENT` #

- `ITM_ARGUMENT` (`item`)
    - `ITM_ARG` (`item`)
    - `ITM_ARGS` (`item`)


This represents an argument type list. This is a list of `ITM_TYPE_MONO` and is
specialized in two versions. `ITM_ARG` contains only one type while `ITM_ARGS`
can contain multiple types

# `ITM_CODE` #

- `ITM_CODE` (`item`)
    - `ITM_LIST` (`item`)
    - `ITM_BLOCK` (`item`)
    - `ITM_RESULT` (`item`)
    - `ITM_BINARY` (`item`)
    - `ITM_OLD` (`item`)
    - `ITM_LDOTS` (`item`)
    - `ITM_EXPRESSION` (`item`)
    - `ITM_OPERATOR` (`item`)
    - `ITM_LIST_IDF` (`item`)
    - `ITM_READ` (`item`)
        - `ITM_READ_ARG1` (`item`)
        - `ITM_READ_ARGS` (`item`)
        - `ITM_READ_ARG2` (`item`)
    - `ITM_EXTERN` (`item`)
        - `ITM_EXTERNAL` (`item`)
        - `ITM_EXTERNAL_TYPE` (`item`)
    - `ITM_WRITE` (`item`)
        - `ITM_WRITE_CAST` (`item`)
        - `ITM_WRITE_VALUE` (`item`)
        - `ITM_WRITE_CODE` (`item`)
    - `ITM_CONSTANT` (`item`)
        - `ITM_PROTOTYPE` (`item`)
        - `ITM_REAL` (`item`)
        - `ITM_CHARACTER` (`item`)
        - `ITM_STRING` (`item`)
        - `ITM_NUMBER` (`item`)

This represents a bit of code in the AST. It can be transformed in code_life
objects (instructions and expressions) using the `to_run` for instructions and
`to_run_expr` for expressions.

The default behaviour of `to_run` is to return the expression from `to_run_expr`
as an instruction is an instruction (`EXPR` inherit from `INSTR`).

# `ITM_TYPE` #

- `ITM_TYPE` (`item`)
    - `ITM_TYPE_MULTI` (`item`)
    - `ITM_TYPE_MONO` (`item`)
        - `ITM_TYPE_GENERIC_ELT` (`item`)
        - `ITM_TYPE_BLOCK` (`item`)
        - `ITM_TYPE_SIMPLE` (`item`)
            - `ITM_TYPE_PARAMETER` (`item`)
            - `ITM_TYPE_STYLE` (`item`)
                - `ITM_TYPE_GENERIC` (`item`)


Dynamic Binding
===============

Dynamic binding is when a slot is called and the receiver is of a polymorphic
type. We have to generate a `switch` C statement to choose which implementation
to use.

When a call to a slot is converted from the AST to code life in
`ITM_READ.to_run_expr`, it creates a `NODE_TYPE` instruction using
`NODE.new_read`. At this stage, the node is not yet ready for the execution
pass and need updates from the depending passes. Updating is divided in
`update_case` and `update_depth`. Note: `update` is deferred in `NODE`.

* `update_case`, beside handling special case for booleans and `Expanded`, will
ask the dispatching `expr`ession for the list of possible runtime types using
`EXPR.get_type`. Then for each type, it will ask the `data` (`DTA`) to produce
a list for a special dynamic type. Then the list is inserted in the `switch`.
As a special case, if the list of dynamic types is empty, don't generate a
switch. If it contains only one type, only store the list generated by the
`data` and don't bother with a `switch`.

* The list generated by the `data` might contains other nodes for further
dispatching. For instance, it can contain a `NODE_STYLE` to dispatch between
different versions of the same code slot (in case the slot has been written
to). `update_depth` role is to call `data.update_branch` on each of the lists
generated by the `data`. The `data` will then take care of updating further
nodes it created. The `type_self` given is either the `type_self` already given
or if `NULL`, the dynamic type.

`NODE_TYPE`, requires a non `NULL` `type_self` when updated (`update_link`).
This type always corresponds to the dynamic type and us used to generate the
`CALL_SLOT` instruction, dispatching on the differents possible slot
implementations.

Call hierarchy example:

    NODE_TYPE.update                                // update depending pass
      update_case type_self=NULL
        EXPR.get_type                               // get dynamic type list
        // foreach dynamic type:
        l := DTA.product with self (type_self=NULL)
          lookup with in                            // parent lookup algorithm
      update_depth type_self=NULL
        // foreach branch in case:
        // type_self is set to the dynamic type of the branch (if NULL)
        DTA.update_branch l:LIST self type_self=t
          l:LIST.first
          NODE_?.update_link type_self=t
          l:LIST.second
          NODE_TYPE.update_link type_self=t
            update_case type_self=t
              ...
            update_branch type_self=t
              ...

# `NODE` #

- `NODE` (`dispatcher`)
    - `NODE_TYPE` (`dispatcher`)
    - `NODE_STYLE` (`dispatcher`)

A `NODE` is a slot call site that need dispatching.

`NODE_TYPE` dispatches polymorphic calls according to an `expr`ession's dynamic
type. The `data` is used to create the code `LIST` for each possible dynamic
type, and further dispatch the call using `NODE_STYLE`.

`NODE_STYLE` dispatches the slot call according to the different possible
implementations of the slot. If the slot has only one implementation, this is
just fine. In any case, it creates a `CALL_SLOT` instruction using the
arguments supplied by the `data`.

The `count` value represents the number of possibilities for dispatching
computed until now.

It has the following different states:

- `switch = NULL` and `first_code = NULL`: No code at all, dispatching on an
  empty set.
- `switch = NULL` and `first_code != NULL`: The dispatching `expr`ession has
  only one possibility. Don't bother generating a `switch`.
- `switch != NULL`: the `expr`ession has more than one dispatching possibility,
  the switch contains a `list` of `CASE` containing the code `LIST`s.


Code Life
=========

Code Life is a special representation of the source code that is losely related
to the syntax and is the best form to perform optimizations.

# `INSTR` #

- `INSTR` (`code_life`)
    - `FORALL_DATA` (`external`)
    - `CALL_NULL` (`external`)
    - `PUT_TO` (`external`)
    - `LOOP_END` (`code_life`)
    - `COP_LOCK` (`code_life`)
    - `LIST` (`code_life`)
    - `CALL_SLOT` (`code_life`)
    - `PUSH` (`code_life`)
    - `COP_UNLOCK` (`code_life`)
    - `NOP` (`code_life`)
    - `LOOP` (`code_life`)
    - `SWITCH` (`code_life`)
    - `WRITE` (`code_life`)
        - `PUT_TO` (`external`)
        - `WRITE_SLOT` (`code_life`)
        - `WRITE_LOCAL` (`code_life`)
        - `WRITE_GLOBAL` (`code_life`)
    - `NODE` (`dispatcher`)
        - `NODE_TYPE` (`dispatcher`)
        - `NODE_STYLE` (`dispatcher`)
    - `EXPR` (`code_life`)
        - ...

This is an instruction. Instructions can be generated in the target language
using the `genere` slot and they are subject to the execution pass through the
`execute` slot.

When executed, an instruction returns a better version of itself as a return
value, or return `NULL` in case it wishes to remove itself.

TODO: What is `remove` exactly?

# `EXPR` #

- `EXPR` (`code_life`)
    - `CAST` (`code_life`)
    - `RESULT` (`code_life`)
    - `EXPR_MULTIPLE` (`code_life`)
    - `READ` (`code_life`)
        - `READ_SLOT` (`code_life`)
        - `READ_LOCAL` (`code_life`)
        - `READ_GLOBAL` (`code_life`)
    - `EXTERNAL_C` (`external`)
    - `SIZE_OF` (`external`)
    - `GET_TYPE_ID` (`external`)
    - `ITEM` (`external`)
    - `IS_EXPANDED` (`external`)
    - `EXPR_BINARY_CMP` (`external/comparison`), contains basic operators for
      `>=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`
    - `EXPR_BINARY_LOGIC` (`external/logic`), contains basic operators for
      `&`, `&&`, `|`, `||`
    - `EXPR_UNARY_LOGIC` (`external/logic`), contains basic operator `!`
    - `EXPR_UNARY` (`external/arithmetic`), contains basic operator `~` (not)
       and `-` (minus),
    - `EXPR_BINARY` (`external/arithmetic`), contains basic operator `^` (xor),
      `%` (mod), `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`
    - `CONSTANT` (`constant`)
        - `STRING_CST` (`constant`)
        - `PROTOTYPE_CST` (`constant`)
        - `CHARACTER_CST` (`constant`)
        - `INTEGER_CST` (`constant`)
        - `REAL_CST` (`constant`)
        - `NATIVE_ARRAY_CHARACTER_CST` (`constant`)


This is an instruction and represents an expression. It does have a
`static_type`. As for all instructions, it is subject to the excuting pass
through the `execute` slot.

An instruction has two execution slots: `execute_link` and `execute_unlink`.
When executed as an instruction (`execute` slot called) the expression unlinks
itself for an instruction by itself do nothing useful.

Expressions are linked together in a tree structure, and linking or unlinking
expressions propagate to children expressions. When an expression is found to be
useful in a computation, `execute_link` is called. But when an expression value
is not needed, `execute_unlink` is called instead.

When an expression is executed as an instruction, its value is not needed so it
is unlinked. Still, if the expression has a side effect, it can choose to return
an instruction as a result to `execute_unlink` or call
`list_current.insert_before`.

# `LIST` #

This is a list of instructions (`INSTR`) and is itself an instruction. This can
be either a list in Lisaac (in braces), a block (curly braces) or contract
blocks (brackets). It has an embedded index that point to a specific
instruction.

TODO: understand how the list return its expressions, given that they are
expressions and not instructions, and that there can be more than one
expression. Is it through `RESULT`?

When executed, it puts itself as `list_current` for the time of its execution
and restore the old value afterwards. Then, for all the instructions it
contains, it excutes the instruction and replace the new instruction (returned
by `execute`) in the list.

The new list (which is the same but modified on the fly) is returned from the
execution step except in the following optimizing cases:

- When there is a call on NULL, all following instructions are removed as they
  are not expected to be executed
- When there is a `list_current` (a parent list). The list move all its
  instructions in the `list_current` just before the child list.

# `PROFIL` #

A profil inherit from `ANY` and is a function signature in C. It represents a
slot in Lisaac that might be customized with generic parameters or for
optimization purposes.

A profil can be living or dead in the `PROFIL_LIST`. Just look at the
documentation on the executing pass for more information about `PROFIL_LIST`.

A profil contains `code` which is a `LIST`. This is the implementation of the
function. When executed through the `execute` slot, it forward the message
calling `code.execute`. And the resulting instruction has better to still be
a `LIST`

`execute_recursive` is not called by `PROFIL_LIST` but by `PROFIL.set_life`
only when in a recursive pass.


Types
-----

There are many prototypes for types, they are expalined here:

- `ITM_TYPE` hierarchy: represent a type plus all that surround the type
  (`Strict`, `Expanded`, genericity, ...). This is only the name of the type in
  the AST.

- `ITM_PROTOTYPE`, `PROTOTYPE_CST`: is a constant reference value to the
  prototype itself respectively in the AST and code life.

- `PROTOTYPE`: The root of an AST, generated by `PARSER`.

- `TYPE` hierarchy: the type information used for code life and execution
  passes. This hierarchy represents a bare type without customization
  (`Strict`, `Expanded`, ...)

- `TYPE_FULL`: type with its customization.

Tools
-----

# `ALIAS_STR` #

`ALIAS_STR.get` serves to convert `STRING` to `STRING_CONSATNT`. The `STRING`s
have to be compared using `==` while only `=` is necessary for
`STRING_CONSTANT`s.

# `ALIAS_ARRAY` #

Storage pool for arrays, keep the memory from groing too much. This will give
you an array with its capacity closest to what you need avoiding too much
reallocation.

# `POSITION` #

Encodes in 32 bits any position in any file parsed now or ever. It contains a
type id, a line number and a column number. 32 bits are a bit small but for the
moment we hold it.

# `PARSER` #

The parser

# `COMMON` #

Common things for command lines. This is used by `LISAAC` and `SHORTER` to
display help and compiler version.
